Autumn in Canada is the most beautiful!
In Canada, autumn is known as the ‘leaf-peeping’ season, and for good reason. 
It’s one of the best places on the planet to see the leaves turn to fiery reds, oranges, and yellows. Wherever you go, the forest canopies will be aflame with brilliant colours and the trees flanking the roadsides will be putting on a gorgeous display. 
It’s one of nature’s most incredible natural phenomena, so grab your passport, get on a plane, and go do some leaf-peeping!
